# Bad Bank
This truly is a bad bank  
## Bad Bank Application  
Bad Bank is a banking application that is still in the works.  It is called the bad bank because it lacks the needed security for a bank.  It almost lacks some functionallity... but we'll deal with that when we have more time.  Don't worry though, I'm no finished.  This project was built to show my skills, and my skills will always be growing; so, this bad bank will always be getting closer to a... half way decent bank!
